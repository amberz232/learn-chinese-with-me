# My First Repository

This is my first GitHub repository. It contains basic HTML practice and will grow as I learn more about web development and Git.

👩‍🏫 I'm currently focused on:
- Teaching Chinese language in Australia
- Exploring Git and HTML basics
- Learning how to organize educational content with code
